# Sudoku

This project was created during Angular Days 2024 in Berlin during an AI workshop.

After creating the project with the Angular CLI, every piece of code was written by Github Copilot using ChatGPT 4o as the model. I just copied all code from left to right, asking Copilot for help for all problems that occurred and prompting it to extend functionality / improve UX to my liking. Not a single line of code was written manually. Although the game is far from perfect, it is playable and was a fun experiment.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
